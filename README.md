# Pharmacometrics Study Groups

Welcome to [International Society of Pharmacometrics](http://www.go-isop.org/)'s Study Group project! From here, we'll set you up with everything you need to get involved in this new exciting study group.

### Wait What's a 'Pharmacometrics Study Group'?

Pharmacometrics Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around your local institution or town to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem or learn new concepts or discuss new advances in our field, and learn and work together with their peers.

## For Participants

Welcome to our Pharmacometrics Study Group! A few things to do & know now that you're here:

 - **Watch this repo:** up in the top right, there's a button that says 'Watch'; click it, and set yourself to 'Watching'. This will send you email notifications of new discussions; if you don't want email, but would like an alert just on GitHub, change the setting in Settings -> Notification Center (Settings is the little cog in the top right).
 - **Check out the issue tracker:** click on 'issues' in the sidebar on the right; this is where all the conversations this study groups is having live. Use this space to ask questions, request events, make suggestions, or just say hi.
 - **Read the code of conduct:** this Study Group is for everyone - we abide by a [set of rules](https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct/) that require everyone be treated with respect. Help us make a space where everyone feels welcome, and we'll all have a better time!
 - **Add yourself to the website:** We provided some details below on how to contribute and add yourself to the website. Bring yourself on!

   - Click on 'Issues' over on the right sidebar of your repo,
   - click the green 'New Issue' button near the top right.
   - You'll then see a form where you can give your event a title and a description - fill these out with all the relevant information:
     - Where will your event be? Include a link to a map.
     - When will it be? Date and time.
     - Should people do anything to prepare beforehand (install any dependencies, set something up?)
